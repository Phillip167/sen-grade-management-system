 Task Management API - SEN Project

This project demonstrates the full *Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)* for a RESTful Task Management System.

 Implementation Details
- Language: Python
- Framework: Flask
- Architecture: REST

 How to Run
1. Install Flask: pip install flask
2. Run the app: python app.py
3. Access the API at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/tasks

 SDLC Consistency
As per the design requirements, all variables and endpoints use the *Task* nomenclature (id, title, description, is_completed) consistently across the documentation and the source code.
